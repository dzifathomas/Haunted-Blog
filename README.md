## Project Title: Haunted Blog

Haunted Blog is an interactive horror blog website that allows the user to experience a story as the protagonist.  
The blog unfolds over **7 days**, where each page corresponds to a single day in the story.

On Day 6, the user is randomly routed to **one of four possible endings**, ensuring a different
experience each time the blog is visited. The project uses interactive **audio and video elements**, 
visual effects, and jump scares to create an immersive horror experience. User decisions influence the 
low of the story and how the experience feels, even when the ending is randomized.
